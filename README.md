# Cross Validation Experiment

## Idea: compare result given by model created with different machine learning algorithms (ANN, SVN, decisiton tree, random forest used) with and without using cross validation parameter optimisation.

In order to run example 'python main.py'. File Configuration.py has constants which should be set properly to determine what subsets of set should be used.
